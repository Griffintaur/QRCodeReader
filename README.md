# QR Code Detector

QR code Detector was developed for fun and to learn opencv and image processing and computer vision. Everyone is welcome to have a look into the code and use it for their purpose.The code is distributed under MIT License.

# Requirements

- **Python 2.7 +**
- **OpenCV 3.2.0 +**
- **Flask 0.10.1 +**

#### I recommend to install Python Anaconda so that all useful libraries are available at one go.
# Working
- All input images are placed under the **Input** folder
- while the generated output images are placed in the **Output** folder
- The input and output folder are fully configured using **config.yml** file

# How To Use
 Just run the call.py to get the output of the images placed in the Input Folder.
 If you want to change the Input folder, just write it in the config.yml file in the input section.
 You can change the location of the ouput folder by configuring it the ouput part.
 Run `python simple_gui.py` to read an image via a GUI having a QRCode or more, in the terminal and you will be automatically redirected to browser. In browser, upload the input image.
